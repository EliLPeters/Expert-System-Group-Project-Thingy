# Expert-System-Group-Project-Thingy

I started writing the prolog file, I pretty much copied the example and just used our scenario instead. I don't have the sheet we worked on in lab so I don't remember all the plants and plant attributes we talked about but that information should be very easy to add.

Cool, thanks!  I didn't have time to get any of the plants entered before heading to work so I'll take care of that when I get home tonight!
